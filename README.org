* file-info-annotator

[[https://circleci.com/gh/jkrmr/file-info-annotator][https://circleci.com/gh/jkrmr/file-info-annotator.svg?style=svg]]

A Node.js command-line script that asynchronously reads files from a directory
and creates an annotated copy of each file (renamed with a timestamp) in a given
target directory.

Each file is annotated with four pieces of information:

1. The name of the source file (e.g. ~file.json~)
2. The source file's relative path (e.g. ~files/original~)
3. The name of the annotated target file (e.g. ~file_EDITED_2015-1-1_12-44.json~)
4. The target file's relative path (e.g. ~files/moved~)

** Usage

The script can be run with ~npm start~ and outputs the results of the script, as
follows:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
% npm start

renamed 5 files, with 0 errors
#+END_SRC

or, for example,

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
% npm start

ENOENT: no such file or directory, open './files/moved/random-json-list_EDITED_2017-09-07_21-26.json'
ENOENT: no such file or directory, open './files/moved/random-json-file-two_EDITED_2017-09-07_21-26.json'
renamed 3 files, with 2 errors (random-json-list.json, random-json-file-two.json)
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
% npm start

./files/original/anothertext-file.json: Unexpected token h in JSON at position 1
renamed 4 files, with 1 error (anothertext-file.json)
#+END_SRC

The script currently handles ~.txt~ and ~.json~ files.

To specify source and target directories, pass the ~--source~ or ~--target~
flags. Defaults are as follows:

#+BEGIN_SRC
% npm start -- --source files/original --target files/moved
% npm start -- -s files/original -t files/moved
#+END_SRC
